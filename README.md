## Tutorials

[Nilaus](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD80bzqJh1N7lOqn7n0vKTg) on YouTube has really good notes on how to base build along with how to's on things like trains and iron smelting, properly laying out ingress and egress inserters for train lines etc...

All the blueprints are from him

## Base Building

### Main Bus

Minimum:

* 4 copper, iron
* 2 green circuit, plastic
* 1 steel, red circuit

Any less than this and your bus will be overwelmed

Recomended Medium:

* 8 copper, iron
* 2 of green circuit (with room for 4 total)
* 2 plastic
* 1 steel
* 1 red circuit (with room for 2 total)

This is enough to get your base to the point where you are launching rockets

Maximum:

* 16 copper, iron (Split iron and copper half/half, 8 lines of each on one side of the bus, the other 8 of each on the other side)
* 6 green circuit
* 4 plastic
* 2 steel, red circuit

This size will work for megabases
