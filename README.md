## Tutorials

[Nilaus](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD80bzqJh1N7lOqn7n0vKTg) on YouTube has really good notes on how to base build along with how to's on things like trains and iron smelting, properly laying out ingress and egress inserters for train lines etc...

All the blueprints are from him

## Base Building

### Main Bus

Dont mix lanes with multiple different items, is messy and dificult to work with.

Make sure to rebalance the bus as certain intervals so you are always drawing from the bus as a group, not just a lane.

Leave space between the bus, and production. I.E. a path to run up and down next to the bus.

#### Minimum

* 4 copper, iron
* 2 green circuit, plastic
* 1 steel, red circuit

Any less than this and your bus will be overwelmed

#### Recomended

* 8 copper, iron
* 2 of green circuit (with room for 4 total)
* 2 plastic
* 1 steel
* 1 red circuit (with room for 2 total)

This is enough to get your base to the point where you are launching rockets

#### Maximum

* 16 copper, iron (Split iron and copper half/half, 8 lines of each on one side of the bus, the other 8 of each on the other side)
* 6 green circuit
* 4 plastic
* 2 steel, red circuit

This size will work for megabases

#### What items to put on the bus

TL;DR Anything that is needed at more than one location. But, you dont want to bring things that are less compressed than what they are made from. For example, copper wire and iron sticks. You want to only put higher compressed items on the bus.

Another rule is: dont bring raw ore on the bus. Instead smelt it immediately after unloading it from your trains. Except for stone, as it's used for rails, both for placing, and for purple science.

Another consideration, things that require iron gears will almost certainly require iron plates, which iron gears are made from. Make the iron gears you need where you need them.

#### Splitting off the bus

3 Types:

* Dedicated lanes
* Prioritised lanes
* Shared lanes

##### Dedicated lanes

Is when you remove a land, or several lanes from the bus. this way you guarantee a certain share of produced resources go to one location.

Should only be used for "Alway on basic products" like green circuits, red circuits, and blue circuits. These items are used in such vast quantities, no matter how much you produce, you will always want more of them.

Scale production of input resources to match the usage.

##### Prioritized lanes

Should be reserved for prioritising a specific item or production for a certain time, such as rails or modules.

##### Shared lanes

Should be the default, and splits a lane evenly between the branch and the bus. This method plays into the main advantage of the bus by allowing all parts of the bus access to shared resources
